Advanced Django Project

I am doing this from a Skillshare class to see how to use Django in a **more advanced** fashion.

Populate .gitignore file:
1. Goto https://gitignore.io
2. Search for "Django"
3. Copy & paste the contents into your .gitignore file

Setup using PyCharm Community Edition:
1. Create new project using virtualenv
2. pip install django
3. Pull this branch from gitHub
